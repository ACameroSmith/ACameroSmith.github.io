Copy the <i>whereami.php</i> page into a new file <i>whereami2.php</i>. 
Rewrite the previous php code as a function <i>extractFolderNumber</i>, and make it more robust: the input is a string that gives a path to some folder; the suffix of numerical characters of the basename are converted into an integer, which is the return value of this function. 
Create a php library file in which you will collect these php functions for future use; name it </i>myLib.php</i> and place it in a folder <i>php</i>. 
Use <i>include</i> to access your php library from the new <i>whereami2.php</i> file. 
Replace the message in <i>whereami2.php</i> with a nicer title stating that this is work for Lab XX (where XX will be computed by invoking the <i>extractFolderNumber</i> php function).
