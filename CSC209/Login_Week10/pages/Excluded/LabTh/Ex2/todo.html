The rest of this exercise is just like Ex2 in Lab <?=  $LABTUID?>. 
The only difference is that now the html page has a title that is created by the php code. 
Now, you want this page to also have a form in it (for the user name and password) and a submit button, which invokes the same php function as in Hw9. The instructions are repeated below. 
The point of this intermediate step is just to get your code organized by type (html, css, js or php), to collect all functions (js or php) in their corresponding folders, and to get you comfortable with the idea of reusing previously written functions by copying the corresponding files from previous labs and homeworks, rather than inserting new code into html files. 
Otherwise, your code will soon become so large and unreadable that it will become difficult to debug or maintain. 
So to complete this step, do the following: create a php file named action_page.php or copy it from Lab <?=  $LABTUID?> step 2. 
When invoked, it should open a new page with a message like: "You just clicked Submit. 
More, later...". 
Place the file into the php folder, in the current lab's folder and make sure you have the appropriate include in your html.php (the main file). 
Try it now in a browser. Click Submit to test.
