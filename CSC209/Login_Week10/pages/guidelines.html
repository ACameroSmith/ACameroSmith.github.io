<ul>
	<li>Each tutorial or lab exercise should be organized as a separate folder with its own html/ css/ javascript/ php files (as applicable), to make the code transparent and easy to debug. When combining several exercises, you copy the necessary code to a new renamed folder. Use your best judgement to decide if it may be necessary to group some logical components of the web app into further sub-folders, according to their functionality.</li>
	<li>If you get stuck with some error that you cannot fix by the deadline: please insert a note on the main html page of the lab or homework, with a description of the bug.</li>
	<li>Use the following organization for each separate web app:
		<ul>
			<li>Style files: in subfolder <i>css</i>.</li>
			<li>Image files: in subfolder <i>images</i>.</li>
			<li>Javascript files: in subfolder <i>js</i>.</li>
			<li>Php files: in subfolder <i>php</i>.</li>
			<li>Data files: in subfolder <i>data</i>.</li>
			<li>Output files: in subfolder <i>output</i>.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
