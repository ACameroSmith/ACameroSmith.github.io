<ul>
	<!-- <li> Starting with this week, our class will be organized around a weekly mini-project on a specific web programming topic. 
	</li> -->
	<li> The mini-project starts as a series of exercises in increasing order of complexity, which are done during the two lab sessions. Then they are combined and extended into a homework. 
	</li>
	<li> You will create a folder with the name of the week (e.g. <i>Week<?=  $WEEKID?></i>), in which you will have two folders for the labs (e.g. <i>Lab<?=  $LABTUID?></i> and <i>Lab<?=  $LABTHID?></i>) and one for the homework (e.g. <i>Hw<?=  $HWID?></i>). 
	</li>
	<li> All work done during the class lab period should be submitted to moodle (as a zip file) by the end of the class period. Then it should be finished and posted to <?=  $WEBSERVER?> within 24 hrs. 
	</li>
	<li> Work on the homework can start as soon as the second lab of the week has been finished. It is due by next <?=  $DAYDUE?> evening before 11:59pm EST.
	</li>
