This is one of the main reasons we are using php. 
To proceed, we need to learn a bit about the php functions that work with files. 
But there is no simple tutorial to follow, so I will guide you with the basics. 
We will use a few functions available in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_filesystem.asp" target="_blank">complete reference for the php Filesystem functions</a>.
<br>
Search in this page for the following six functions that we will frequently use (today, only three of them: open, close and write). 
In each case, read and replicate the example showing how to use the corresponding php function (you can finish the other three after the class):
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fopen.asp" target="_blank">fopen</a>: opens a file or url. Retain that you can open a file just to read it, or to write into it, or to append to it. Retain the syntax for each of these three possibilities. The example there is with the "read" option. For write, replace "r" by "w".</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fclose.asp"target="_blank">fclose</a>: closes a file or url.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fread.asp" target="_blank">fread</a>: reads from a file.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fwrite.asp" target="_blank">fwrite</a>: writes to a file. Notice what happens if the file to which you want to write does not exist.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_file_exists.asp" target="_blank">file_exists</a>: checks if a file or folder exists.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_glob.asp" target="_blank">fglob</a>: returns an array with all the files and folders present in a given folder (directory).</li>	
</ul>
