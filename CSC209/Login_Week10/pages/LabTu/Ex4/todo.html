Copy the <i>form2.html</i> and <i>welcome.php</i> files from Step 3 into new files named <i>login.html</i> and <i>saveUsers.php</i>. 
Modify the html file to have two input fields, for a user name and a password. 
Modify the php file to retrieve the user name and password into two php variables, echo them in the response html page to make sure they have been correctly retrieved, and then write the user name and the password submitted through the form into a file named <i>users.txt</i>. 
The <i>users.txt</i> file created by the php script will be stored into a separate folder named <i>output</i>, also located in your Lab<?=  $LABTUID?> folder.
