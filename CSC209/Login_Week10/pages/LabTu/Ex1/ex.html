From W3schools. 
From the tutorial on 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp" target="_blank">html forms</a>. 
Read and copy the code from the 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_submit" target="_blank"> 
first exercise</a> into a file <i>form1.html</i>. 
Read the description and try to understand the code. 
Notice that when you open the html form in the browser, nothing happens when you click on the Submit button: the <i>action_page.php</i> file is missing, it was not provided. 
We will handle it in the next step.
