Create a php file named <i>action_page.php</i>. 
When invoked, it should open a new page with a message like: "You just clicked Submit. More, later...". 
Place the file into a <b>new folder</b> named <i>php</i>, in the current lab's folder. 
Adapt the path from the <i>form1.html</i> file created at step 1, to the <i>action_page.php</i> file you just created. 
Try it now in a browser. 
Click Submit. 
Your message should now appear (although it is not telling you anything very interesting yet).
