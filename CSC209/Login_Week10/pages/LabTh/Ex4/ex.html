If the login page has been accessed meanwhile by new users, the file users.txt may have changed. One way in which the webadmin could get the updated information is to refresh (reload) the admin.html.php page.

Another more general possibility is to have a button on the page that performs this action at the request of the webadmin, without having to manually reload the page. The button action should get access to and read from the users.txt file and then should update the webadmin page.

It is instructive to attempt to implement this approach, but I warn you ahead of time that it will not work. The point of the exercise is to make you aware that something else is needed, which we will introduce in the next exercise.

Here is the attempted solution: when the button is clicked, we invoke a php function that extracts the users. This function is invoked and it should (in principle) update a variable giving the number of users. Then we would expect the page to reflect the new value.

What can go wrong? Discussion.
