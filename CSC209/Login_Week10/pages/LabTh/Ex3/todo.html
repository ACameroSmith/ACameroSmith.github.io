Imagine that you are the administrator of a web site for which the login page provides an entry point (well, it will provide in the future, after we implement more features). 
You will create a small web app to create some reports for you about the site. 
To get started, you just want to know how many users have accessed the site and have created an "account". 
This information is in the users.txt file, located in the output folder.

Our goal is to create a web app with the following description:
The "view" shown in the browser will be a page that displays the number of users recorded in the users.txt file (located on the server) followed by a list of the user names.
