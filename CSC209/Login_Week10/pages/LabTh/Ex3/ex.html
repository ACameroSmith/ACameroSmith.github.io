This exercise extends the mini-login exercise you did in Lab <?=  $LABTUID?>. 
Copy the files <i>login.html</i> and <i>saveUsers.php</i>. Rename <i>login.html</i> as <i>login.html.php</i> and combine with the <i>whereami2.php</i> exercise from last week to give it the current lab's title. 
Run in a browser a few times, to create the <i>users.txt</i> file with user names, in an <i>output</i> folder.
