<h1>Hw 5: A Login Web app</h1>
<ol>
	<li>1. A styled login form.
		<div class="exercise" id="exHw1">
			From W3schools. From the How To <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_login_form.asp" target="_blank">Login form</a>. Learn how to create a responsive login form with CSS.
		</div>
		<div class="todo" id="todoHw1">
			<b>To do:</b> read and understand the code. Reorganize its resources into images, css, js and php folders.
		</div>
	</li>
						
	<li>2. Basic php. 
		<div class="exercise" id="exHw2">
			This part assumes you did the php tutorials recommended for Hw4. <b>Hint:</b> for this step, you do not need more than the <i>echo</i> command in php, described <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_echo_print.asp">here</a>. 
		</div>
		<div class="todo" id="todoHw2">
			<b>To do:</b> Create a php file named <i>action_page.php</i>. When invoked, it should open a new page with a message like: "You just clicked Submit. More, later...". 
			Place the file into a <b>new folder</b> named <i>php</i>, in the current lab's folder. Adapt the path from the <i>form1.html</i> file created at step 1, to the <i>action_page.php</i> file you just created. Try it now in a browser. Click Submit. Your message should now appear (although it is not telling you anything very interesting yet).
		</div>
	</li>
						
	<li>3. Php Forms: processing POST requests.
		<div class="exercise" id="exHw3">
			From W3schools. Read the tutorial on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_forms.asp">php form handling</a>. We will be using almost exclusively the <i>POST</i> method described here. 
		</div>
		<div class="todo" id="todoHw3">
			<b>To do:</b> Copy the code from the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_submit"> first exercise</a> into a file <i>form2.html</i>. Copy the accompanying code for <i>welcome.php</i> into a separate file, place it into the php folder. Read and try to understand it. Adapt the path to the welcome.php file in form2.html.<br>
			Open now the form in the browser. Click on submit. Notice what happens: the information you submitted has now been processed and reported back to you in a new web page.
		</div>
	</li>
		
	<li>4. Saving the submitted information in a file on the server.
		<div class="exercise" id="exHw4">
			This is one of the main reasons we are using php. To proceed, we need to learn a bit about the php functions that work with files. But there is no simple tutorial to follow, so I will guide you with the basics. We will use a few functions available in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_filesystem.asp">complete reference for the php Filesystem functions</a>.<br>
			Search in this page for the following six functions that we will frequently use (today, only three of them: open, close and write). In each case, read and replicate the example showing how to use the corresponding php function (you can finish the other three after the class):
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fopen.asp">fopen</a>: opens a file or url. Retain that you can open a file just to read it, or to write into it, or to append to it. Retain the syntax for each of these three possibilities. The example there is with the "read" option. For write, replace "r" by "w".</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fclose.asp">fclose</a>: closes a file or url.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fread.asp">fread</a>: reads from a file.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_fwrite.asp">fwrite</a>: writes to a file. Notice what happens if the file to which you want to write does not exist.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_file_exists.asp">file_exists</a>: checks if a file or folder exists.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_glob.asp">fglob</a>: returns an array with all the files and folders present in a given folder (directory).</li>	
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="todo" id="todoHw4">
			<b>To do:</b>
			Copy the <i>form2.html</i> and <i>welcome.php</i> files from Step 3 into new files named <i>login.html</i> and <i>saveUsers.php</i>. Modify the html file to have two input fields, for a user name and a password. Modify the php file to retrieve the user name and password into two php variables, echo them in the response html page to make sure they have been correctly retrieved, and then write the user name and the password submitted through the form into a file named <i>users.txt</i>. The <i>users.txt</i> file created by the php script will be stored into a separate folder named <i>output</i>, also located in your Lab9 folder.
